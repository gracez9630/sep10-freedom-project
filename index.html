                    <h5>Software</h5>
                    <p>For photography, software is used to help edit photos that were taken to make the photos look more professional or appealing. Some examples of softwares that photography use would be:</p>
                    <h5>Adobe	 Lightroom</h5>
                    <p>Adobe Lightroom is a software that photographers use to make changes to a photo without permanently changing the photo.</p>
                    <h5>Photoshop CC</h5>
                    <p>Photoshop CC is used for it’s editing software which makes photos look more modernized with upgraded tools and it can access Lightroom photos.</p>
                    <h5>Affinity Photo</h5>
                    <p>Affinity Photo is a software that is easy to learn and master with a low and affordable cost.</p>

                    <h2 id="part-b">Part B: Future Invention Ideas</h2>
                    <h5>A. Camera glasses</h5>
                    <p>We planned to do a future idea that can help improve photography. It is a pair of glasses but works like a camera with phone functions. There would be a miniature button somewhere at the glasses that when pressed could take a picture of whatever you're seeing and transfer it to your phone, desktop/laptop and tablet for editing purposes.  It would have better lenses to make the image look clearer, better lighting to look more presentable, and is both portable and waterproof. It would also use solar and electric energy while catching memorable moments in a convenient and faster way than pulling out your phone.</p>
                    <h5>B. Pop up pictures (hologram)</h5> 
                    <p> Another idea we planned to do is another future idea that can help improve photography even more is a pop up picture when editing them (aka hologram). It works the same exact way as you can take pictures on a phone (one button). Can be used underwater and take pictures live with more details than the normal camera. Has better editing qualities, and it is like in mid air. Also, when looking at the photo, it would be presented as a 3d photo.</p>
